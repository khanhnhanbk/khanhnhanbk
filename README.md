Hi, my name is Nhan. 😊 I’m from Quang Nam Province and I’m currently a student at Ho Chi Minh University of Technology, majoring in computer science. 💻

I’m really passionate about technology and love building websites that can help people with their everyday tasks. 🌐 It’s amazing to create something that can make a difference in someone’s life!

In my free time, I enjoy playing chess with friends or online. ♟️ Chess is a great way to challenge myself, practice my thinking skills, and stay sharp. I believe it helps me become smarter and more strategic in my decisions.

I also love talking to people and sharing ideas. 💬 I’m a talkative person who enjoys learning from others and exchanging thoughts on different topics. It’s always exciting to connect with new people and hear their stories.

My goal is to become a successful person, not just in my career, but also in maintaining good health, both physically and mentally. 🧠💪 I believe that a balanced life is key to happiness and fulfillment.

Thanks for getting to know me! 😊
